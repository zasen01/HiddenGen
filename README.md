# Password Generator 

 * This is a password generator that created a password according to users selected inputs.

    It can include or exclude the following:
        - Upper Case Letters: A-Z
        - Lower Case Letters: a-z
        - Special Charachters: -_@!$&%*#
        - Numbers: 0-9

When the user clicks 'Generate Password' They will be asked if they would like the Password to include the above items. If they click "ok" when the generator runs they will be added to the password.

The console log prints each run of the for loop and the password thus far until the password reaches the desired length.

This was one of the first JS homework assigments I had during my time at a Full Stack Devloper bootcamp hosted by my home insistution. For future iterations I was hoping to add a feature to auto copy the password so that it could be saved/pasted to a place of your choosing on your local machine. Local storage is not a secure place for a password to be stored.
