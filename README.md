# Password Generator 

 * This is a password generator that created a password according to users selected inputs.

    It can include or exclude the following:
        - Upper Case Letters: A-Z
        - Lower Case Letters: a-z
        - Special Charachters: -_@!$&%*#
        - Numbers: 0-9

When the user clicks 'Generate Password' They will be asked if they would like the Password to include the above items. If they click "ok" when the generator runs they will be added to the password.

The console log prints each run of the for loop and the password thus far until the password reaches the desired length.
